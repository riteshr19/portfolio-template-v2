Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I'm an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying at Boston University, pursuing a Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering. I recently graduated from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) with an MBA in Technology Management.

I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Software Development. I specialize in working with frontend, backend, database, and cloud technologies. My primary coding languages are Python and JavaScript (React). I have experience with AI and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and I am skilled in developing robust, scalable software solutions.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, watch football ‚öΩ, cook, play the guitar, explore neighborhoods through food, and occasionally bring out my inner photographer. Also, did someone say sushi? üç£
